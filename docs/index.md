# STAC Catalog Builder

This tool generates a STAC collection from a set of GeoTiff images.

It is mainly intended to create STAC collections and catalogs for use in [openEO](https://openeo.org/), with the load_stac process.

It requires a some configuration for the fields we need to fill in, but the goal is to make it much easier to generate STAC collections from a set of EO images.
